# Open Sentinel

Open Sentinel mitigates chance by extraordinarily decreasing the time a hacker goes undetected in secure networks.

The framework, made out of a passive device associated with each subnet, screens network traffic for suspicious action's such as ICMP (Ping) Scans, TCP Half-Open Scans, TCP Connect Scans, UDP Scans and so on, producing an alert and conveying countermeasures when activated.

It is coded in C++11 and runs on most platforms and devices.

## Building

Although Boost is not used it is required for the Boost.Build system (bjam). As C++17 is being supported on more compilers we will be adopting std::filesystem, etc instead of using Boost moving forward. Asio will continue to be used until C++20 which will include native support.

 * Linux - Run ./build_linux.sh

 * MacOS - Run ./build_macos.sh

## Using

Open Sentinel uses the `system` call to execute a user defined script when a threat is detected. The examples directory contains a script that works with the [pushd](https://pushed.co) service. The script MUST be located in the current users data directory. On Linux this would be `~/.opensentinel/data/` and on MacOS this would be `~/Library/Application Support/opensentinel/`. The script MUST be named `threat_alert.sh` but can be changed if need be.

Open Sentinel MUST be run as root on Unix-like systems and Administrator on Windows systems.

To test your Open Sentinel setup simply point your favorite `LAN scanner` at it or send a UDP packet(`echo -n "hello" >/dev/udp/192.168.1.16/8100`) or connect with your `web browser` to one of the passive ports such as 8100.
